DevOps learning is essential in modern software development life cycles (SDLC) because it helps develop, operate, and collaborate among IT teams. Large organizations can apply DevOps principles to deliver faster and more reliable quality software.
DevOps enables teams to efficiently send code to production, apply hotfixes quickly, and detect errors before they cause major system failures.
DevOps engineers play an important role in system stability, scalability, and security. DevOps learning helps developers understand the full life cycle of an application.
