DevOps Overwview
DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to improve collaboration between development and operations teams.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a DEvOps practice where developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests are run to detect errors early.
Benefits of DevOps include:
- Faster software delivery
- Improved collaboration
- Reduced deployment failiures
- Faster recovery time
