Git Branching Overwview

Git branching allows developers to work on different features independently without affecting the main branch.

Each team member in this project works on their own branch and later creates a pull request to merge changes into the main branch.

Advantages of using branches:
- Prevents conflicts
- Keeps main branch stable
- Allows parallel development

After finishing work on a branch, always create a pull request to merge changes into the main branch after review. This ensures code quality and avoids conflicts.
